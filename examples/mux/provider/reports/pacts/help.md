# For assistance debugging failures

- The pact files have been stored locally in the following temp directory:
  /Users/mfellows/go/src/github.com/ray-xu-deltatre/pact-go/examples/mux/provider/tmp/pacts

- The requests and responses are logged in the following log file:
  /Users/mfellows/go/src/github.com/ray-xu-deltatre/pact-go/examples/mux/provider/log/pact.log

- Add BACKTRACE=true to the `rake pact:verify` command to see the full backtrace

- If the diff output is confusing, try using another diff formatter.
  The options are :unix, :embedded and :list

  Pact.configure do | config |
  config.diff_formatter = :embedded
  end

  See https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby/blob/master/documentation/configuration.md#diff_formatter for examples and more information.
